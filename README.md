# Spotify True Shuffle - Backend

Spotify's built-in shuffle pushes certain tracks rather than being randomly ordered.

True Shuffle creates custom playlists with randomised order of tracks for a better shuffle experience.

Backend built on Flask in Python (Migrated from Spring Boot)

Frontend can be found in [this](https://github.com/This-Is-Ko/spotify-true-shuffle-react) repository.

## Deployment

Current set up to automatically deploy commits to the "main" branch using PythonAnywhere
